                                <p>Abyssinia Ethiopian Cuisine serves tasty food in reasonably priced, 
                                    we have a variety of options for vegetarians and meat lovers. This 
                                    Ethiopian restaurant is about people trying and getting a glimpse of the 
                                    culture.</p>
                                <p>Many dishes come served on top of injera, a soft, flat, slightly sour bread. Traditionally this type of dish 
                                    is eaten by scooping up toppings using the bread. The combinations of flavors is wonderful.</p>

<h3>5 stars*****<h3>
<p> “A good friend recommended this place. He told me I could experience different kinds 

of food, a lot of food without spending a lot. He was RIGHT. Very good food. I was disappointed that 

it was closed today. Some must try items seafood noodles and beef curry from the Burmese window. 

Spicy chicken from the Sudanese window. Beef tibs from the Ethiopian window. All very good.” </p>

<p>“Good coffee in fancy cups with friendly service. This is not something I was expecting but I was 

very happy to have found in Buffalo. The lady was very genial and helpful. We ordered the traditional 

coffee and a mixed fruit smoothie. The coffee was bold and smooth, and the smoothie was what the 

daughter needed to chase away the tiredness of a long drive.“ </p><p>
