                                    we have a variety of options for vegetarians and meat lovers. This 
                                    Ethiopian restaurant is about people trying and getting a glimpse of the 
                                    culture.</p>
                                <p>Many dishes come served on top of injera, a soft, flat, slightly sour bread. Traditionally this type of dish 
                                    is eaten by scooping up toppings using the bread. The combinations of flavors is wonderful.</p>

                            <p>“Good coffee in fancy cups with friendly service. This is not something I was expecting but I was 

very happy to have found in Buffalo. The lady was very genial and helpful. We ordered the traditional 

coffee and a mixed fruit smoothie. The coffee was bold and smooth, and the smoothie was what the 

daughter needed to chase away the tiredness of a long drive.“ </p><p>
